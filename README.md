# homeserver
A set of tools to move, save, and serve media files to my home server.

## Format for Plex "Music"
* https://support.plex.tv/articles/200265296-adding-music-media-from-folders/
* Music/ArtistName/AlbumName/TrackNumber - TrackName.ext

MP3 files use the ID3 tag for their metadata. 

For my home server, this format would translate to:
* HomeVideo/Grandchild/DiskTheme/TrackNumber - FamilyEvent.mp4

It would be very nice to be able to find all videos where someone is on screen.
For an event like "Grandparents day", which grandparents are in it?
Similar to Amazon's X-Ray view of movies
